ideas:

~ = maybe
* = easy
^ = hard
slots (Kaido can take up multiple team slots)
system to compare teams (stats, member size, captains) ^
average stats of a given team *
create heroes and teams through user input *
add descriptions (lore) to each hero given by the system, with the ability ->
-> to add lore to heroes added through user input ^~
implementation of a nemesis/chemistry/friend system? (batman v joker) ~
implementation of a save state (text file)? *~
multi user implementation with login system? *
captain boost? (1.2x/1.5x to a given stat? or add a weakness?) ~
sorts teams into highest to lowest? (stats, members, alphabetical order?) ^
admin login + limit to hero create for admin perms? (hard coded/interface) ^




(possible mechanics)
Fighting
Teams can have the bool hero or villain
Teams can only fight bool if on oposing sides?
Fighting takes user inputs or simulation occurs


admins can
create and remove heroes--(for balance purposes)
Delete teams
See all teams created and by what user
Change changes made by user, (ex edit a teams name)

Users can
create teams
add from a pool of characters created by the admin
name the team
add a description to there team
possibly use battle functionality
